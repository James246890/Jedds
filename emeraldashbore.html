<h1>The Emerald Ash Borer</h1>
<img src="images/eab2.jpg" alt="pests">
<p>Agrilus planipennis, otherwise known as the Emerald Ash Borer, is a green jeweled beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species.
In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to that area.
Outside its native range, however, it is viewed as an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America.
Before it was discovered in North America, very little was known about the Emerald Ash Borer in its native range.
This has resulted in much of the reseach done on the Ash Borer being done in North America.
Local governments outside the Ash Borer's native range are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.</p>
